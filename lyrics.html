            [Intro]
(Lost my balance, lost my way)
(Was it malice, I can't say)
(But I heard it all before)
(Back when I was worlds away)

(Out of options, out of breath)
(Waiting on what heaven sent)
('Cause I haven't lost the war)
(I wish you nothing but-)

[Verse 1]
Why do good things have to end?
With broken hearts or losing friends
By now I've seen a thing or two
(By now I've seen a thing or two)

Glad I stayed just for a while
I can't help but stop and smile
Like that there's nothing left to lose
(Like that there's nothing left to lose)

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Alright, alright, you showed your colors
Really, I'm fine, so please don't bother (Please don't bother)
I'm not one for asking questions
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)

[Chorus]
Lost my balance, lost my way
Was it malice, I can't say
But I heard it all before
Back when I was worlds away

Out of options, out of breath
Waiting on what heaven sent
'Cause I haven't lost the war
I wish you nothing but the best

[Verse 2]
Moved on, so long, time to look past it
I'm up-down, clocked out, far too distracted
But I'm done losing sleep thinking of you
(I'm done losing sleep thinking of you)

'Cause I'm 24 and I got a bone to pick
Yeah, I wanted more, now I think I'm over it
Had to keep the old me back to make it through
(Keep the old me back to make it through)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
(Lost my balance, lost my way)
(Was it malice, I can't say)
(But I heard it all before)
(Back when I was worlds away)
Out of options, out of breath
Waiting on what heaven sent
'Cause I haven't lost the war (The war)
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)

[Chorus]
Lost my balance, lost my way
Was it malice, I can't say
But I heard it all before
Back when I was worlds away

Out of options, out of breath
Waiting on what heaven sent
'Cause I haven't lost the war
I wish you nothing but the best
